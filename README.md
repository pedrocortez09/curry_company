# 1. Business Problem.

Curry Company created an application that connects restaurants, delivery people and people.

Through the application it is possible to order food at any registered restaurant and receive it in the comfort of your home by one of our registered deliveryman.


With so many requests being made, the database grew and my goal was to create dashboards for viewing the main business metrics through a web page where the CEO could easily interact and view


# 2. Business Assumptions.

The assumptions about the business problem is as follows:

- The analysis was made with data between 11/02/2022 and 06/04/2022;
- Marketplace was the business model we assume.


# 3. Solution Strategy

The strategic dashboard was developed using metrics that reflect the 3 main types of visions of the company:

1. Growth of the Company
2. Growth of Restaurants
3. Growth of Delivers

Each view is represented by the following metrics:

1. Vision Growth of the Company:
  - Orders by day;
  - Percentage of orders by traffic conditions;
  - Number of orders by type and by city;
  - Orders by week;
  - Number of orders by type of deliver;
  - Number of orders by traffic conditions and type of city.
  
2. Vision Growth of Restaurants:
  - Number of unique orders;
  - Mean distance travelled;
  - Mean time to deliver on festival days and regular days;
  - Mean time to deliver by type of city;
  - Mean time to deliver by typo of order.
  
  
3. Vision Growth of Deliver:
  - Oldest and yougest deliver;
  - Rating of the best and worst vehicle;
  - Mean rating by deliver;
  - Mean rating by traffic conditions;
  - Mean rating by weather conditions;
  - Mean time of the best 10 deliver; 


# 4. Top 3 Data Insights

1. The seasonality of the number of orders is daily. There is a variation of approximately 10% of orders on sequential days.

2. Semi-urban type of city does not have low traffic conditions.

3. The greatest variations in delivery time occur on sunny days


# 5. Final Product

Online panel, hosted in the cloud, available for access from any device connected to the internet.

The panel can be acessed by this link: [https://phccurrycompany.streamlit.app/]  

# 6. Conclusion

The objective of this project is to create graphs and tables that display the metrics in the best possible way to help the CEO of the company

We can conclude that the number of orders increased considerably between weeks 05 and 13 of the year 2022

# 7. Next Steps
